// Additional logic for other parameters (like fuel capacity, driver hours, etc.)...
    // This might involve additional API calls, complex if-else logic, or even a separate function


Fuel Capacity: This doesn't directly translate into a route parameter for the TomTom API. Instead, you may need to calculate potential refueling points along the route based on the truck's fuel capacity and range.

Driver Hours: Implementing logic to handle driver's hours requires understanding legal limits and planning stops/rest periods accordingly. This might involve segmenting the route into multiple parts based on the hours a driver can continuously operate.

Dynamic Route Planning: Some parameters may require dynamic route adjustments, possibly necessitating real-time data processing and frequent re-routing.

For factors like traffic and weather, consider integrating real-time data feeds to make dynamic routing decisions.

The actual implementation depends on the capabilities of the TomTom API. Not all parameters (like axle weight or turn radius) may be directly supported. In such cases, you might need to implement custom logic to filter and evaluate routes.

Database Integration: For dynamic and real-world data (like traffic patterns, weather conditions, rest areas), integrating with a database that stores and updates this information would be crucial.

Real-time Adjustments: The route may need to be adjusted in real-time based on changing conditions, driver input, or vehicle status, which adds another layer of complexity.

It may involve making trade-offs or prioritizing certain factors over others.
